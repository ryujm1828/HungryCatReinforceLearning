# HungryCatReinforceLearning
## Outline
- [HungryCat Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Truer.HungryCat)
- The goal is to develop an artificial intelligence for games that mimics a FlappyBird called HungryCat.
- It made by Unity And ML-Agent
## Information of this environment
1. The number of State is 6. (the cat's y-coordinate, the pipe's x-coordinate, the pipe's y-coordinate, the pre-pipe's x-coordinate, the pre-pipe's y-coordinate, the cat's y-velocity)  
2. The number of Action is 2. (NoJump(0) ,Jump(1))
3. If you play game on HungryCat.exe, demo file will generate in ./HungryCat/HungryCat_Data/Demonstrations
## Implimented Algorithm
- A2C : Failed
- DQN : Failed but better than A2C

#### The implementation algorithm code referred to the book [파이토치와 유니티 ML-Agents로 배우는 강화학습]
